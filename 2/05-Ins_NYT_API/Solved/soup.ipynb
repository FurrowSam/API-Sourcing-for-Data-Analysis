      "Title: Traditional Polish Recipe For an Easter Sunday Feast  || White Borscht by Chef Michael Angeloni\n",

      "\n",
      "- Though the idea of creating a dish may seem like an easy task, Chef Michael shared that it is quite a lengthy process. It begins with an idea of where he wants to be at with the dish, whether it’s a main course he has heard of before, or a certain type of protein.  Next, he will consider the different components and exciting elements to create a unique taste that everyone would enjoy. Once he has sketched up the final piece, the real fun begins where he tastes his creation, plates it and shares it with the team around the restaurant for feedback.\n",

      "Step 1: Cut sausage lengthwise and add to large pot along with a few leek green tops. Add 1250mL of cold water and 1 cup chicken broth, on top of sausage and leeks. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for approx. 25-30min.\n",
      "Step 2: Cut sausage lengthwise and add to large pot along with a few leek green tops. Add 1250mL of cold water and 1 cup chicken broth, on top of sausage and leeks. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for approx. 25-30min.\n",
      "Step 3: Once cooked, remove the sausage, and set aside. Strain the water and set aside (this is the broth used for cooking), discard the leek greens. Slice about half sausage into half-moon shapes at your desired thickness and leave to the side for later. The uncut pieces can also be left to the side.\n",
      "Step 4: Once cooked, remove the sausage, and set aside. Strain the water and set aside (this is the broth used for cooking), discard the leek greens. Slice about half sausage into half-moon shapes at your desired thickness and leave to the side for later. The uncut pieces can also be left to the side.\n",
      "Step 5: Slice the leek whites lengthwise (in half) and wash well, then thinly slice them. Peel the potatoes. Dice the potatoes into ¾ inch cubes, and when dicing, save all scrapes of potatoes (trim the potato into a “box” shape to help get a perfect dice).\n",
      "Step 6: Slice the leek whites lengthwise (in half) and wash well, then thinly slice them. Peel the potatoes. Dice the potatoes into ¾ inch cubes, and when dicing, save all scrapes of potatoes (trim the potato into a “box” shape to help get a perfect dice).\n",
      "Step 7: In a pot, add the butter and heat over medium high heat. Once the butter begins to foam lightly, add the onions, garlic, and leeks. Stir well, season with salt and pepper, and place a lid on the pot (the pot will cause steam and condensation which will help to soften the onions and leeks). Cook for about 8min, carefully opening the lid and stirring periodically until the onions and leeks are soft and translucent.\n",
      "Step 8: In a pot, add the butter and heat over medium high heat. Once the butter begins to foam lightly, add the onions, garlic, and leeks. Stir well, season with salt and pepper, and place a lid on the pot (the pot will cause steam and condensation which will help to soften the onions and leeks). Cook for about 8min, carefully opening the lid and stirring periodically until the onions and leeks are soft and translucent.\n",
      "Step 9: Add in the potato scraps, stir well. Add the chicken broth if using, the whole pieces of sausage you saved, and enough of the sausage water to just cover the vegetables. Cook for about 25min or until potatoes are soft. Remove the soggy bread and about 1 cup of the liquid, if some veg comes along with it that is fine. Now add in the remaining sausage water, and diced potatoes. Add a bit more salt (you will season again at the end) and cook for another 20-25min or until the potatoes are cooked.\n",
      "Step 10: Add in the potato scraps, stir well. Add the chicken broth if using, the whole pieces of sausage you saved, and enough of the sausage water to just cover the vegetables.

Now add in the remaining sausage water, and diced potatoes. Add a bit more salt (you will season again at the end) and cook for another 20-25min or until the potatoes are cooked.\n",
      "Step 11: Puree the bread and liquid until smooth and add back to the soup. Bring to a boil and mix well. Add the sliced sausage, now whisk in the sour cream, turn off the heat and add in the dill. Check seasoning. Place 1 cut up egg into each bowl and pour hot soup over top.\n",
